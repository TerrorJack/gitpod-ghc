# `gitpod-ghc`

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/TerrorJack/gitpod-ghc)

My personal Gitpod workspace. Main intended use case is hacking GHC in
a browser, but also batteries-included for numerous other tasks as
well.

## How to use

- You need a Gitpod account (they support logging in via GitHub). No
  need to fork this repo if you don't intend to change the default
  environment.
- Click "Open in Gitpod" above.
- Wait for the workspace to load, it'll automatically refresh to open
  `/workspace/ghc`.
